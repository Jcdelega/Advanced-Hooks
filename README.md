# 🛒 Inventory Manager - React Workshop

Welcome to the **Inventory Manager** project! In this workshop, we’ll build a simple and powerful tool to manage product inventory using **React** and some advanced hooks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Imagine you're managing an online store and need a user-friendly way to track and update your inventory. This project helps you build a responsive inventory manager app that supports:

- ➕ Adding products with a name and quantity.
- 🔼🔽 Increasing or decreasing the quantity of each product.
- ❌ Removing products from the list.
- ⚛️ Managing state efficiently using `useReducer`.
- ⚡ Improving user experience with `useRef`.
- 🚀 Optimizing performance with `useCallback`.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- React (with Hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite
- CSS for styling
- Bootstrap & Bootstrap-icons

---

## ⚙️ Features and Functionality

### 🔁 State Management with `useReducer`
All inventory-related actions (add, update, remove) are handled through a reducer function for predictable state transitions.

### 🧠 Better UX with `useRef`
Focus management is enhanced using `useRef`, allowing input fields to auto-focus and streamline user input.

### 🧠 Performance Boost with `useCallback`
Functions that are passed as props or reused are memoized with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
